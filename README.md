## 🚀 About Me

I'm a developer from **Minas Gerais, Brazil** 🇧🇷.

My programming journey began at 12, fueled by curiosity. Today, I dedicate my time to the challenging world of **Game Development** and **Tooling**. I believe in building high-performance, developer-friendly tools to help others bring their ideas to life.

Currently, I'm focusing on building a complete ecosystem for 2D game development.
